# Fake-News-Detection-using-Neural-Network-model
Fake News Detection with LSTM
This notebook will walk you through the process of detecting fake news using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We will start by loading the data and exploring its features. Then, we will train the LSTM model and evaluate its performance.
# Fake-News-Detection-Using-LSTM

## 1. Introduction

In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly online, detecting fake news is more critical than ever. This project leverages deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their textual content.

The goal is to build an automated pipeline that can analyze news headlines or full articles and determine the authenticity of the information, helping platforms and users combat the spread of disinformation.

## 2. Project Overview

We implement a text classification pipeline that includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Text vectorization using Tokenizer + Embedding Layer
- LSTM model for sequence classification
- Evaluation using standard metrics
- Optionally, a web interface (Flask) to interactively test the model

## 3. Dataset

We use publicly available fake news datasets such as:
- **Fake and real news dataset** from Kaggle
  - [https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

Each sample typically contains:
- Title
- Text/body
- Label (`REAL` or `FAKE`)
